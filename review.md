TURN: Instinct


# review.md: quality control for `instinct-prototype-v3`

This branch starts from `instinct-prototype-v2` @ `4433b05`. The v2 review is kept in `review-v2.md` (all 30 findings verified), with older history in `review-archive.md`.

**Goal:** one system. The three agents and their three databases are the only home for customer data. Abel's app, `/arch.html` (read and write) and `/dev-monitor.html` (read only) run on the same server and the same data. No separate simulated prototype remains.

| Who | Role |
|---|---|
| **Bill** (Claude) | Quality control. Reviews against the criteria below, runs tests and live checks, writes findings. Does not edit code. |
| **Telkomsel** | Builds. Reads the findings, changes the code, posts an ETA with each hand-over. |
| **Joe** (Claude) | Communication rules and Context memory. |
| **Habibil** (owner) | Approved this plan on 1 Nov 02:27. Not supervising; Bill acts on his behalf. |

## Protocol v2 (Joe): token budget first

**Hot file / cold files.** `review.md` holds only what changes: TURN, this protocol, Context memory, open findings, newest messages. Cold, read only when you need a specific id (`grep -n G3 review-*.md`): `review-spec.md` (criteria), `review-v2.md`, `review-archive.md`.

**Turns and git**
1. Loop **Telkomsel → Bill → Telkomsel** (line-1 token stays `Instinct`); act only when line 1 names you. Joe has no turn; edits only Protocol, Context memory, archive/spec moves; never `TURN:` or anyone's message.
2. `git pull --rebase` before editing and before committing; non-force push; never push to `main`.
3. Commit message `<Name>: <what>. TURN: <next>`. Off-turn: code commits ok, no `review.md` edits, message ends `TURN: <current> (unchanged)`.

**Reading (the biggest cost)**
4. Poll `git ls-remote` (one line), not the file. Skip commits whose author is Joe (`git log -1 --format=%an`); they never change your turn.
5. On your turn read **only the delta**: `git diff <last-seen>..HEAD -- review.md`. Never re-read the whole file or the cold files.
6. Honour posted ETAs: no checks before the ETA, then every 10 min.

**Writing**
7. Messages in CMP (`KEY: value`, keys DID · FACT · G<n>: · ASK@X #id / ANS #id · OWNER · OWNER-Q · ETA · STATE · NEXT), **max 8 lines**. No greetings, thanks, or restating a finding row or the other agent's claims: cite the id.
8. A verify is one line: `G1: verified @hash`; a reopen ≤ 3 lines. Message times come from `date +%H:%M`, never typed.
9. Evidence = commit hash or `path:line`. No code, logs or diffs. Tests as one line: `FACT: test:arch 188/188, lint 0 @hash` (run them with `| tail -3`, never paste output).
10. Finding rows ≤ 1 line, status only in the table. Once verified, Joe collapses the row into `Verified: G1 @hash, …`.
11. Batch: hand over two or more findings at once where possible (fewer round trips).
12. Prose only for a design disagreement; one short paragraph.

**Keeping it small (Joe)**
13. Context memory ≤ 15 lines, updated only at hand-overs. More than **5** messages → Joe archives all but the newest **2** to `review-archive.md`, unchanged.
15. **Fewer pushes:** every push wakes the others. Fold fix-ups (lint, typos) into your next real commit instead of pushing them alone.
16. **Short lines:** a CMP line ≤ 150 characters; over → split it or cite `path:line`; details go in the commit message. A pre-commit guard will enforce it (OWNER 03:02).
17. The owner asks Joe for progress, so Bill and Telkomsel don't spend context on status reports. `ASK@Joe` if a rule costs more than it saves.

## 🧠 Context memory
*Joe, updated 2026-11-02 02:42.*

- **Goal:** one system: 3 agents + their DBs are the only home for customer data; Abel, arch.html (rw), dev-monitor (ro). Done = V1–V8.
- **Owner:** hosted = 3 tables in one Supabase project, one policy per agent; external MCP agent after v3 (V9 out).
- **Owner:** all 3 agents LLM-driven (V4); on conflict Telkomsel follows Bill; Groq free tier for live runs.
- **Owner (16:22):** Abel answers ONLY from finalised context.md; Bill's 4 conditions (16:26) are the QC gate.
- **Owner (16:35–17:44):** cabinet-db.json → 3 agent DBs only, auto-delete after verify, NO backup; offers retire, imports stay.
- **Owner:** standing OK for assigned repo work (01:04); spending and live Supabase legs 3–5 still need his word.
- **Verified:** G1–G29, G33, G34 (Verified line).
- **Now (Telkomsel, Bill 02:37):** G32 leg 3 ✓ live on hosted (demo uid only, baseline 8/36/241 intact). Legs 4–5 owner-blocked.
- **Naming (owner 02:03):** the builder is **Telkomsel**, signs `[Telkomsel]`. Line-1 `TURN:`/`NEXT:` token and branch name stay `Instinct`.
- **Open:** dotenv bug: store modules read X_DB_URL before `dotenv.config()` (ESM hoisting). Legs 4–5: nordea-feed.sql + role-smoke output.
- **Next:** Telkomsel: fix dotenv ordering if Bill OKs; legs 4–5 and offers/abel.ts/hosted ×2 need the owner.

## The criteria
V1–V9 are in [`review-spec.md`](review-spec.md) (static; read once). One-line index: V1 one data layer · V2 every screen through the agents · V3 agents react, CM is the hub · V4 LLM-driven agents · V5 `/arch.html` read-write · V6 monitor read-only · V7 proof it is one machine · V8 nothing from v2 breaks · V9 out of scope (external MCP agent).

## Findings

Baseline review of `instinct-prototype-v2` @ `4433b05` against V1–V8. Severity: **H** blocks the goal, **M** needed for it, **L** polish.

| Id | Sev | V | Finding | Evidence | Status |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|:-:|
| G32 | M | V7 | Closing live pass on the final code is missing (owner 16:31): checklist in Bill 16:33. | `review.md` | open |
| G30 | H | V2 | Two Abels: app /api/chat runs legacy abelTurn (routes.ts:142); arch.html runs the personal agent (arch/routes.ts:43); no shared history. | `src/server/routes.ts:142` | open |
| G31 | M | V4 | Observability gaps: dev-monitor lacks per-agent data cards + actual model labels; both pages refresh slowly after activity. | `public/dev-monitor.html` | open |

Verified: G1 @95de3d4, G5 @95de3d4, G2 @17a640b, G9 @ac8b828, G10 @67d2e87, G3 @01f3663, G7 @f961762, G11 @f961762, G8 @f6c4e62, G12 @d7afe82, G13 @d7afe82, G4 @6e95e1d, G14 @fb807f7, G6 @64613fb, G15 @58aa3fa, G17 @485786e, G16 @8578295, G18 @6bae205, G19 @9550952, G21 @98ae872, G20 @b0134a3, G22 @b0134a3, G23 @53dec36, G25 @d8c6ba1, G26 @d8c6ba1, G24 @d4ebaf1, G27 @d4ebaf1, G29 @79aeb98, G28 @0778fec, G33 @e35f62f, G34 @4844ff8

**Suggested order:** G30 + migration → G31 → G32 → merge is the owner's call.

```
Handoff so Bill records his leg-3 live-check evidence (restart/fresh-dir persistence,
uid-scoped hosted cleanup, baseline 8/36/241 restored, zeroLLM). No hosted op by us.
Env finding CONFIRMED read-only: the three store modules call configureRemote(kind,
process.env.X_DB_URL) at module top level; ESM hoisting evaluates imports before
server.ts runs dotenv.config(), so .env DB URLs never land (same class: DATA_DIR,
GEMINI candidates). load_remote.ts reads after config() and works. remote.ts Pool
takes connectionString only, no ssl option; uselibpqcompat+sslmode noted. No edits.
NEXT: Bill
```

### [Bill] 2026-11-02 02:37

G32 leg 3 VERIFIED live on the hosted project, demo uid only: hydration matched baseline (user 8 / cm 36 / nordea 241).
demo-leg3 goal+mock chat wrote user +3, cm +8; restart with a wiped data dir re-hydrated them; delete reported
hosted=cleared for both stores; post-check demo rows 0 everywhere, baseline intact (alex/eeva/lauri untouched).
Zero real LLM calls (LLM_PROVIDER=mock); TLS needed uselibpqcompat=true in the URL; env finding acked, no code edit by me.
Legs 4-5 still owner-blocked: nordea-feed.sql (roles lack CREATE on public) + role-smoke.sql owner-run output.
NEXT: Instinct
```
